This simple software takes the complete path of an image as input and runs a face detection algorithm on it.
The algorithm used here is the Haar-Cascade Face Detection Algorithm.
It is a part of an ongoing project that involves utilizing AL/ML concepts - particularly Computer Vision - for a wide range of tasks.
